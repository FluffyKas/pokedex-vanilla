# Pokédex

I't s a small side project of mine, a Pokédex containing information about all pokémons from the Kanto region. For now, this project is purely vanilla, I created it to practice and improve on vanilla JS skills.

It's a work in progress, I mean to add more features in the future and fix some existing problems.

### What I learned

### Work in progress

I plan to add some sort of display that would provide more information about each pokémon (height, weight, moves, etc). I'm still debating what would be the best way to do this (perhaps some sort of modal).

The search functions at the moment work well separately but when used together, there's a bit of a mess, I'm meaning to fix this, so when you have a pokémon type selected, the searchbar will only search for names from the given list.
